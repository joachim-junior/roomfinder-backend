## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Environment Variables (Production)

Verify these are set correctly for PRODUCTION:

#### Database
- [x] `DATABASE_URL` - Production database

#### Security
- [ ] `JWT_SECRET` - **CHANGE TO STRONG PRODUCTION SECRET**
- [ ] `FRONTEND_URL` - Set to production domain
- [ ] `NODE_ENV=production`

#### Email
- [x] `EMAIL_USER` - Gmail account
- [x] `EMAIL_PASSWORD` - App password
- [x] `EMAIL_FROM` - Sender email

#### Firebase
- [x] `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=roomfinder-237`
- [x] `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` - Service account key
- [x] `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL` - Service account email

#### Fapshi
- [ ] **IMPORTANT:** Verify Fapshi configs are set to `PRODUCTION`
- [ ] `FAPSHI_API_KEY` - Production key
- [ ] `FAPSHI_SECRET_KEY` - Production secret
- [ ] Check: `/api/v1/admin/fapshi-config`

---

## üö® Critical: Fapshi Production Setup

‚ö†Ô∏è **Before going live, verify Fapshi is in PRODUCTION mode:**

```bash
# Login as admin
POST /api/v1/auth/login
{ "email": "hansyufewonge@roomfinder237.com", "password": "@Hans123" }

# Check Fapshi configs
GET /api/v1/admin/fapshi-config

# Ensure PRODUCTION environment is ACTIVE for:
# - COLLECTION (for receiving payments)
# - DISBURSEMENT (for host payouts)
```

**Switch from SANDBOX to PRODUCTION:**

```bash
PUT /api/v1/admin/fapshi-config/:id
{
  "environment": "PRODUCTION",
  "isActive": true,
  "apiKey": "production-api-key",
  "apiUser": "production-user"
}
```

---

## üîí Security Recommendations

### 1. Change JWT Secret
```bash
# Generate strong secret
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"

# Update .env
JWT_SECRET=your-new-strong-secret-here
```

### 2. Enable HTTPS
- Ensure production deployment uses HTTPS
- Railway provides HTTPS by default

### 3. Set CORS Origins
```javascript
// In server.js
app.use(cors({
  origin: process.env.FRONTEND_URL || 'https://yourdomain.com',
  credentials: true
}));
```

### 4. Rate Limiting
- Already configured in the API
- Monitor for abuse
